Description: Scripts for the Grml system for an easier life
 Some scripts which should make life easier.
 .
 This package contains a lot of scripts and is only really suited for
 full Grml systems. It provides, amongst others: grml-mutt, grml-slrn,
 iimage, make_chroot_jail.sh, sepdate.pl, sepdate.rb, sepdate.sh*,
 wwwis.
 If you're on a plain Debian system, it's recommended to install
 grml-scripts-core instead.
 .
 Notice: not all the packages which are required for all the scripts
 are in the "Depends:" line. If you want to get a full featured
 grml-scripts package install the packages from the "Suggests:" line
 too or just use the full Grml system.
 .
 For more details take a look at the grml-scripts manpage.
