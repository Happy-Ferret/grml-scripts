Description: Collection of little tools
 This package contains a lot of scripts and is only really suited
 for full Grml systems. It provides, amongst others: iimage,
 make_chroot_jail, qma and myip.
 .
 Notice: not all the packages which are required for all the
 scripts are in the "Depends:" line. If you want to get a full
 featured grml-scripts package install the packages from the
 "Suggests:" line too or just use the full Grml system.
 .
 For more details take a look at the grml-scripts manpage.
