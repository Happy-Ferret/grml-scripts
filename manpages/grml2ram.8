.TH grml2ram 8
.SH "NAME"
grml2ram \- copy compressed Grml image to RAM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grml2ram
.SH DESCRIPTION
grml2ram is a script which copies the compressed Grml image to RAM and unmounts
/cdrom then. This allows ejecting of the CD (run 'eject /dev/cdrom' for example)
afterwards.  Therefore running the Grml live system without the need for a
present Grml-ISO is possible.  Please notice that you need enough free RAM to
run grml2ram. At least enough space for the compressed Grml image itself
(roughly the size of the ISO) and for running userspace software afterwards (at
least 128MB are recommended) should be available.
.SH OPTIONS
grml2ram supports only the following option:
.TP
.B -f, \-\-force
Force copy process for Grml image even though the check for enough free RAM fails.
